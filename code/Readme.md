The NLP analysis process began with data preprocessing for two selected papers, "Intelligible models for healthcare" by Caruana et al. (2015) and "Global reconstruction of language models with linguistic rules" by Binder et al. (2022). Text was cleaned, tokenized, and summarized to identify key themes and findings. Topic modeling and keyword extraction highlighted primary research areas and essential terms. Sentiment analysis gauged overall sentiment. The comparative analysis revealed that Caruana et al. emphasized healthcare and the importance of interpretable models in predicting pneumonia risk and readmissions. Binder et al. focused on explainable AI in online consumer reviews, introducing linguistic rules for model reconstruction. While both papers addressed interpretable models, Caruana prioritized healthcare applications, and Binder explored explainable AI in consumer reviews, offering valuable insights into their respective domains.
